## Usage

To use Twilight Watcher, simply submit the episode you have seen into the submittal form, along with the rating and review, which will automatically log it into the episode list. Ratings can be changed from the episode list. Everything you add or have already seen will be logged and will be displayed on future uses. You can also switch between users and see what your friends have seen, and comment on your friends' reviews. If you want to find and display a specific episode, enter it into the 'Find Episode' form and, if the episode is in the list, the display will change to just that episode.
